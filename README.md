### App Info.
#### [Purpose]:
When you want to practice '1 on 1 fight' in the Firing Range,<br>
you might choose your most favorite gun-combination every time.<br>
Of course, it is an important practice.<br>
However, I found out some necessities of practices under randomized situation.

1. The situation that the opponent has better gears
	- A higher level evo-shield
	- Red-tier weapons
	- Fully kitted weapons
2. The first close fight with unfavorable weapons
	- No weapons
	- Only one weapon
	- Charge Rifle
	- P2020
	- ~~Mozzi~~
	- ...
3. Weapons with less kits
	- No mags
	- No lasersights
	- No scopes
	- ...

*(And for other bad situations)*

#### [Features]:
1. TBA
